# Neokaiju
NEOKAIJU is a fast-paced destructive platformer game where you play as an ever-evolving kaiju wreaking havoc on 
the city beneath you. Save the baby kaiju trapped in power cells scattered through the city, race to destroy as 
much as you can within the time limit, and level up to your ultimate form!

I joined the Neokaiju project on its second semester of development and quickly became the lead developer of the game.
We actually worked on the project using SVN, I'm just uploading the source code (no assets) to GitHub for our interview.

Some of my responsibilities:
* Architected game framework and main character in Unreal Engine C++, focusing on proper design principles, code organization, and ease of use for artists.
* Coordinated engineering team, delegating responsibilities across team members to speed up development process.
* Communicated with tech artists to gather software requirements and establish programming interfaces.
